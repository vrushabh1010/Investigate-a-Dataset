# Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 2

## Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. 
We will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.

#### What do we need to install?
We will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

It is recommended to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. 

## Why this project?
In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
We have to use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

## What I have learned?
After completing the project, I have learned following:

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
